# Capstone Overview

### R​E​A​D​ME Organization :book:

Capstone READMEs are organized across subfolders to guide the readers. Project findings specific to selected topic are summarized under Data Cleaning & EDA and Modeling, Evaluation, Recommendations proper. The last part documents the broad steps taken to deploy the model.

**Jupyter Notebook Organization**

The notebooks are located in `codes` folder. 

Notebooks are arranged via following system: *1st digit . 2 digit . 3 digit*

- 1st digit: Project number (Capstone: 5)

- 2nd digit: 
- **Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Engineering** and **save to csv file** : **0** , 
  - **Model Prep, Modelling, Evaluations & Recommendations** : **1**
  - **Topic Modeling: 2**
- **Image generation for gif: 3**

For example,

  - notebook 5.0 represents the note book on Capstone, data cleaning, eda, etc.
  - notebook 5.1 represents the notebook on Capstone, Machine learning model building
